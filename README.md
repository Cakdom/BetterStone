Space Engineers mod to add lots of variety to the ore types in the game.
It immensely adds to the overall immersiveness of the game.

Fun history snippet:
This mod used to actually have several custom textures made by me, but as I am not a super-good artist (or the artwork required more time than I hoped to spend on a mod), the textures were not as good as many of the textures added into the vanilla game. Since most of those textures were actually rarely seen in-game, I was able to harness them and reuse them as the textures for the new ores that I added into the game. Because those textures are already in the main game, and do not need to be downloaded when this mod is downloaded, it reduced the size of this mod from several-hundred megabytes to a few dozen kilobytes. That made it superlight and all the more cooler.
